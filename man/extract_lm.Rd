\title{Extract Relevant lm Components}
\usage{
extract_lm(lm, alpha = 0.05, output = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{lm}{linear model}

\item{alpha}{user-defined alpha; define the threshold for significance. Default is 0.05.}

\item{output}{controls whether the extracted components are published in the console, default is 'TRUE'.}
}
\value{
dataframe of relevant lm components
}
\description{
extract relevant summary components from a linear model
}
\details{
The user is able to extract model details while also allowing for a user-defined alpha value of significance. This offers a more flexible model summary output
than the summary() function, where the alpha value is strictly set to 0.05. The output can be used to generate a more flexible model summary dataframe if used directly,
or this function will also be called as an internal function to both 'tablestack' and 'tablecomp', as it allows for more flexibility with the alpha value.

\examples{
#fit linear model
 data(faraway_teengamb)
 lmod<-lm(gamble~sex+status+income+verbal+sex:income, data=faraway_teengamb)
#extract components, supplying 'output=TRUE' to print output
 extract_lm(lmod)
