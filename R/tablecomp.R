#want to put the extracted model components in a table for side-by-side comparison with each model it's own column, predictors on the right, and something where you
  #user chooses the values placed in each cell, like: [coef estimate] concatenated with the pvalue and stars? With the option to instead have the output value be confintervals, etc?
  #return(extract)
