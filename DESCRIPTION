Description: User is able to extract model details while also allowing for a user-defined alpha value of significance. This offers a more flexible model summary output than the summary() function, where the alpha value is strictly set to 0.05. The output can be used to generate a more flexible model summary dataframe if used directly via 'extract_lm()', or this function will also be called as an internal function to both 'tablestack' and 'tablecomp', where the output summaries of desired model components can be compared directly between similar/nested models. This offers a great advantage when completing courses like 'Biostatistical Methods I or II', where it is common to have to compare and contrast various model components between various iterations of a model. These display options, via 'tablestack()' and/or 'tablecomp()' take away the inefficiency of scrolling between various model summaries, and instead offer side by side or a stacked view of output for easy and direct viewing/ comparison.
